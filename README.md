# 🚀 NexusGen — Personalized AI Knowledge & Search System

NexusGen is an ongoing learning-focused Gen-AI project where I explore and implement 
core concepts of modern LLM systems such as:

- Embeddings  
- Vector Databases  
- Semantic Search  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Prompt Engineering  
- Document Processing & Chunking  
- Model Grounding  
- AI Evaluation and Hallucination Reduction  

This project is NOT about building a full product.  
It is a structured, practical lab where I learn Gen-AI by implementing each concept step-by-step.

## 🧠 Purpose of NexusGen
The goal of NexusGen is to create a system where:

1. **I upload documents** (PDFs, notes, text files)  
2. The system **chunks and embeds** them  
3. A **vector store** holds these embeddings  
4. I can ask questions  
5. The system retrieves relevant chunks and uses **RAG** to give accurate answers  

This helps me understand how real-world AI systems are built internally.

## 📌 Project Status
🔧 **Actively in development**  
I am learning and implementing each module one at a time.

Current Focus:  
- Understanding embeddings  
- Implementing vector storage (FAISS)  
- Building a basic retrieval pipeline  

Upcoming:  
- RAG pipeline  
- Retrieval evaluation  
- Frontend chat interface  
- Document citation system

## 🧩 Planned Modules
This project is divided into learning modules:

- `01_basic_embeddings`  
- `02_chunking_and_preprocessing`  
- `03_vector_database`  
- `04_semantic_search`  
- `05_RAG_pipeline`  
- `06_prompt_engineering`  
- `07_evaluation`  
- `08_UI_and_frontend`  
- `09_optional_fine_tuning`  

Each module is a separate learning step with code + explanations.
